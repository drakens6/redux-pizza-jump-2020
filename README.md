This is the Redux Pizza Menu Project!

# A Pizza Menu with Redux

## Requirements

You will be developing an application with 4 views. Our pizza shop has various crust types, sauce types, and additional toppings, and we need an order-builder to make it easy for customers to order, and to turn that into detailed instructions for us. Think like some other fancy pizza chains that have an order builder.

- Screen for entering who and where the pizza should go to
- Screen for selecting sauce level and crust type
- Screen for selecting additional toppings
- Screen for displaying the final order
- Data should maintain between screens

Develop in a way that looks appropriate in both mobile and desktop.

Customer Fields: Email, Address, Phone Number, Name
